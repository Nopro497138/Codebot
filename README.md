# Codebot
This is a simple discord bot for coding/dev communities. It is really helpful and raises engagement.
# What it does
Codebot features a way where people can send their code into the bot. It will be scanned for malware etc. and then it will run the code. The bot now takes a screenshot of a highlight from the code. The code will be sent in a form with a small description and the screenshot.
# How to use it
You can simply authorize the bot trough the following link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1409505265195421716&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot
Then:
 1. Set the Forum channel where the forum will be created.
 2. Tell your users to submit code.
 3. See if it works.
 4. Enjoy!

# WARNING
Use this bot at your own risk. If the bot somehow gets hacked trough a suspicous code, then we are not responsible for your broken server. By adding the bot you automatically agree to that!
